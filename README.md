An AI Attendance Monitoring and Management System validates whether a person has attended
a meeting or lecture or not. AI Attendance monitoring and management systems can be used as a
confirmation system which tells that the right people are in the right place at the right time.
These days there is a correlation between students' academic performance and punctuality to
classes. Therefore, the faculty of the institute needs to be well equipped with a proper way of
managing attendance in classrooms and examinations venues.

Attendance management can be carried out in many ways. This includes the old traditional method
of attendance registry used in schools. This includes lecturers invigilating studentâ€™s circulation of
attendance register for students to indicate their presence by appending their signature or automated
attendance management system. Since many attendance-monitoring systems are prone to problems
such as false result time wasting cheat and use of expensive material such methods are not being
used till date. As a result, computer based attendance monitoring systems are being explored to
build a better space for attendance management.

We humans are visual creatures. Almost every one of us depends on a site to interpret the world.
Most information and discoveries are the product of our visual faculty. Although the site is not the
only channel to acquire information, it is regarded as the greatest source of collecting information
and growing the knowledge.

Students can acquire more information and understand better, when they attend classes. Knowledge
is enriched by listening. Being focused in any particular meeting or lecture can help a student
gather more and more information about the topics of the meeting or lecture. It has been reported
that students who do not punctually attend their classes showed a poor academic performance than
those who attend their classes properly.

Time is the key factor while going through various attendance management systems. A
considerable amount of time is consumed in classes to mark each and every student present, as the
teacher calls names of the students, trying to figure out whether the student is present or not.
Several times students play pranks on teachers that may go undetected. Also, doing so, it is
disturbing to circulate a register to collect student signature in between the exams, risking many
students to sign for the absentees.

Unfortunately, most educational institutions are still using paper-based attendance monitoring
methods. This method is found tedious, inconvenient, time wasting, and a waste of paper material.
As the number of students increases throughout the years, it is becoming a challenging task for
institutions to manage the attendance register.

Existing automated modalities such as mobile application, RFID and Bluetooth based-systems are
also prone to false results, intrinsic models, time wasting, and expensive instruments. Hence, the
need to improve the attendance monitoring system is necessary. True authentication and
identification are important features for attendance recording.

We cannot guarantee a full-blown error free attendance management system as long as the students
play pranks. Facial recognition application can be susceptible to false positives and false negatives,
invariant lighting, facial occlusion, and drastic change in facial expression. A well-structured facial
recognizing system can improve attendance management. This non-intrinsic nature makes facial
recognition biometric systems to be essentially preferred when compared to other forms of
biometrics.
